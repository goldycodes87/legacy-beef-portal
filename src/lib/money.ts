/**
 * One balance calculation for the whole business.
 *
 * Mirrors legacy-beef-admin/lib/money.ts. Keep the two in sync until they are
 * extracted into a shared package.
 *
 * Two rules this encodes, both of which were previously wrong somewhere:
 *
 * 1. The card processing surcharge is a fee, not money toward beef. A card
 *    deposit is stored with the surcharge included in amount_cents, so
 *    crediting the full amount against the balance under-charged every card
 *    customer by the surcharge.
 * 2. Discounts are part of the balance. Recomputing a balance without the
 *    discount term silently re-bills a customer you gave a discount to.
 *
 * All arithmetic runs in integer cents; only the returned values are dollars.
